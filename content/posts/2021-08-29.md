Recently read a lot of book written with R bookdown. After reading this, I want to write a good book/note about medicine study. There is a tradition in Taiwan, that we will write notes together. There are too many things to study the origin textbook and class. The students then found a way to conquer the exam, called 'collaborative notes'. After so many years, we have small teams to decide the distribution and merge different team's note. It sounds wonderful that you don't need to study all the subjects, but only the part you get. You can then read the note other people made. However, there are a lot of problems IRL. Different school, of course, is independent. Even in the same department, there are always people who only want to taste the fruit without working hard. Therefore, I had a idea of a system that combine all the different resources into one book.

In these two days, I built the github pages, and then tried to build the summary of the book. It is much harder than I thought. The range of what we need to read is fuxking ambiguous. I can't really find the good system of what we should read. Not like language test, giving you some direction of what you should prepare. The website of the government only said the names of the subjects, like "physiology", "Pathology", .... etc, which is useless in my opinion. Therefore I tried to read the exam in the past to get some idea. Maybe I can get it done next week.

終於開始寫自己的共筆了，有點興奮，也真的希望自己能把它完成，然後使用這個共筆度過國考。

共筆說實在話，我真的很討厭這種半強制的制度。到底哪個腦筋正常的會想寫共筆，當然是看學長姐的就好啊XDD，誰還浪費時間做共筆，讀都來不及了。但總歸，會覺得共筆無用或浪費時間，我覺得單純是因為大家目標不同，又沒有統一的平台。現在都有markdown這種方便的工具了，當然是用這種東西比較方便，又好編輯。所以既然沒有人想弄，就決定自己生一個了。雖然有像題庫豹之類的考古網可以做使用，但是一方面我覺得太商業了，一方面，內心資工的小火苗告訴我，就是要用git才夠潮(並沒有。另外，為了先把筆記的架構弄好，還去了考選部的網站下載考古題，發現有夠難用，真的是內心一把火。

另外，這周也發現github action如何正常的使用，很有趣，很方便，難怪會有人覺得網路上的社群真的是世界推動的力量，使用之後真的深感認同。最近大概是我真的認真碰github的一段時間了，希望開學之後我還能維持一周更新一篇。
